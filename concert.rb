# Create a Concert!!!!
#
# A promoter has asked you to create a concert application for them. You'll have a Ruby application where you can:
#
# Display to the user a list of opening-acts that they can choose from
# Let the user choose 2 of the opening-acts
# Let the user enter information for a new headline-act
# Let the user press "Play" and output the acts in order
# Due: Monday morning, 9am
#
# For example:
#
# "Grave Band -> 20 minutes"
# "Freaky Friday -> 30 minutes"
# "HEADLINER: Dave's Weeekend -> 70 minutes"
#
# Tech Details
#
# Have Band class that gets populated by the user
# More than 2 bands in your app for user to choose from
# class Band
# end
#
# #....
# band_name = gets
# Band.new band_name
